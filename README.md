# Shop App

This is a small shop app built with React + Redux + TypeScript + Node.js + GraphQL.

It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting started

```
git clone https://github.com/celiagomezdev/shop-app.git
cd shop-app
yarn
yarn start
```

## Commands

### `yarn start`

Runs both server and client in the development mode (for more information, check the scripts on `package.json` file).

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the client app in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

Open [http://localhost:4000/graphql](http://localhost:4000/graphql) to view the server (graphql playground) in the browser.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
